  "Question: <|vision_start|><|vision_end|>In the figure, in quadrilateral ABCD, AD = 6, AB = 4, and DE bisects angle ADC, intersecting BC at point E. What is the length of BE? A. 2 B. 3 C. 4 D. 5\nObserve the image and reason step by step before answering.\n###Step 1:  We are given a parallelogram ABCD with AD = 6 and AB = 4. DE bisects ∠ADC and intersects BC at E.  We want to find the length of BE. ###Step 2: Since DE bisects ∠ADC, we have ∠ADE = ∠EDC. ###Step 3: In parallelogram ABCD, AD || BC , so ∠ADE = ∠DEC (alternate interior angles). ###Step 4: Since ∠ADE = ∠EDC and ∠ADE = ∠DEC, we have ∠EDC = ∠DEC. ###Step 5: In triangle CDE, since ∠EDC = ∠DEC, triangle CDE is an isosceles triangle, so CD = CE.###Step 6: In parallelogram ABCD, CD is parallel to AB. So AB = CD = 4. ###Step 7: Therefore, CE = CD = 4. ###Step 8:  We can see that BE = BC - CE. Since BC = AD = 6, we have BE = BC - CE = 6 - 4 = 2. \nThe final answer is: A."
