  "Question: <|vision_start|><|vision_end|>In the figure, in quadrilateral ABCD, AD = 6, AB = 4, and DE bisects angle ADC, intersecting BC at point E. What is the length of BE? A. 2 B. 3 C. 4 D. 5\nObserve the image and reason step by step before answering.\nStep 1: <visual_clues> We are given a parallelogram ABCD with AD = 6 and AB = 4. DE bisects ∠ADC and intersects BC at E. <visual_clues_end> We want to find the length of BE. ###Step 2: Since DE bisects ∠ADC, we have ∠ADE = ∠EDC. ###Step 3: <visual_clues> In parallelogram ABCD, AD || BC <visual_clues_end>, so ∠ADE = ∠DEC (alternate interior angles). ###Step 4: Since ∠ADE = ∠EDC and ∠ADE = ∠DEC, we have ∠EDC = ∠DEC. ###Step 5: In triangle CDE, since ∠EDC = ∠DEC, triangle CDE is an isosceles triangle, so CD = CE.###Step 6: <visual_clues> In parallelogram ABCD, CD is parallel to AB. <visual_clues_end> So  AB = CD = 4. ###Step 7: Therefore, CE = CD = 4. Step 8: <visual_clues> We can see that BE = BC - CE. <visual_clues_end> Since BC = AD = 6, we have BE = BC - CE = 6 - 4 = 2. \nThe answer is: A. <end_of_answer>",
  "Question: <|vision_start|><|vision_end|>Which person works at this facility?\nA. red top\nB. back kid\nC. front kid\nD. purple shirt\nObserve the image and reason step by step before answering.\nStep 1: <visual_clues> In the image, there are several individuals, including children and adults, interacting with horses in what appears to be a riding facility <visual_clues_end>. To determine who works at this facility, we need to look for visual clues that indicate someone is in a supervisory or instructional role. ###Step 2: <visual_clues> The person in the red top is standing near the horses but does not have any distinguishing features. <visual_clues_end> This suggests that they are working at the facility. ###Step 3: <visual_clues> The back kid is on a horse. <visual_clues_end> He appears to be a participant rather than a worker. ###Step 4: <visual_clues> The front kid is also on a horse, <visual_clues_end> indicating he is likely a participant as well. ###Step 5: <visual_clues> The person in the purple shirt is walking and appears to be guiding or supervising the activities. This person is not on a horse and is wearing a shirt that might be part of a uniform or work attire <visual_clues_end>, suggesting she is in a role of responsibility. ###Step 6: Based on these observations, the person in the purple shirt is most likely the one working at the facility.\n The answer is: D. purple shirt <end_of_answer>"
