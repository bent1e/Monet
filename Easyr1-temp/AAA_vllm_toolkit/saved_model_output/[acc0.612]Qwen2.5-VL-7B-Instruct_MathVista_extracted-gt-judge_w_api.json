    "question": "When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

The Orange points also form a straight line but start at the bottom left and slope upward to the top right.\n\n2. **Compare the slopes**: \n   - The Firebrick line is decreasing, meaning its value decreases as the x-axis increases.\n   - The Orange line is increasing, meaning its value increases as the x-axis increases.\n\n3. **Determine the area under the curve**:\n   - The area under a curve can be visualized as the space enclosed between the curve and the x-axis.\n   - For the Firebrick line, the area under the curve is the space between the Firebrick line and the x-axis from x=0 to x=100.\n   - For the Orange line, the area under the curve is the space between the Orange line and the x-axis from x=0 to x=100.\n\n4. **Visual inspection**:\n   - The Firebrick line starts higher on the y-axis and maintains a higher value throughout the range compared to the Orange line.\n   - The Orange line starts lower on the y-axis and increases but never reaches the height of the Firebrick line.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Firebrick line is consistently above the Orange line across the entire range of the x-axis, the area under the Firebrick line will be greater than the area under the Orange line.\n\nTherefore, the Firebrick line has the maximum area under the curve.\n\n\\boxed{Yes}",

Therefore, ∠ABC = 60° implies that the measure of arc AC is 2 * 60° = 120°.\n\n3. **Determine the measure of arc CD:**\n   - Since the total measure of the circle is 360°, the measure of arc CD is 360° - 120° = 240°.\n\n4. **Use the property of the cyclic quadrilateral:**\n   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to 180°. However, we need to find ∠CDE, which is not directly related to the cyclic quadrilateral property but rather to the straight line formed by extending AD.\n   - When a line is extended through a point on a circle, the angle formed with the chord is equal to the angle subtended by the same arc at the circumference. Here, ∠CDE is the angle formed by the extension of AD and the chord CD.\n\n5. **Calculate ∠CDE:**\n   - Since ∠CDE is an exterior angle to the triangle ACD, and it is formed by the extension of AD, it is equal to the angle subtended by the arc CD at the circumference, which is half the measure of arc CD.\n   - Therefore, ∠CDE = 1/2 * 240° = 120°.\n\nThe measure of ∠CDE is \\boxed{120} degrees.",

    "raw_response": "To determine the fuel efficiency of an average city bus, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the type of vehicle**: A city bus is a large vehicle designed for public transportation in urban areas. It typically has a higher fuel consumption rate compared to smaller vehicles due to its size and weight.\n\n2. **Research typical fuel efficiency**: The fuel efficiency of city buses can vary depending on the make, model, and specific design features. However, as of recent data, the average fuel efficiency for city buses in the United States is around 6-8 miles per gallon (mpg).\n\n3. **Consider factors affecting fuel efficiency**: Factors such as the age of the bus, the type of engine, the weight of the bus, and the driving conditions (e.g., stop-and-go traffic) can affect the actual fuel efficiency. Newer, more efficient models might achieve higher mpg, while older or less efficient models might be lower.\n\n4. **Average value**: Given the variability but aiming for a general estimate, the average city bus gets approximately 7 miles per gallon.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{7}",

So, ∠AOE + ∠EOC + ∠BOC + ∠AOC = 360°.\n   - Since ∠BOC = 50° and ∠AOC = 50°, we have ∠AOE + ∠EOC + 50° + 50° = 360°.\n   - Simplifying, ∠AOE + ∠EOC + 100° = 360°.\n   - Therefore, ∠AOE + ∠EOC = 260°.\n\n4. **Use the property of the angle bisector:**\n   - OD bisects ∠AOE, so ∠AOD = ∠DOE.\n   - Let ∠AOD = ∠DOE = x.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design. Which of the following could Cooper's test show?",

This is one of the key requirements set by the city council.\n\n2. **Design Development**: Cooper developed three possible designs for the park, each placing the concert area in a different location.\n\n3. **Testing the Designs**: Cooper tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area. This measurement is crucial because it directly addresses whether the concert area meets the requirement of being at least 150 meters away from the road.\n\n4. **Outcome of the Test**: The test results would provide data on the actual distances measured for each design. If any of the designs do not meet the requirement (i.e., the distance is less than 150 meters), Cooper will need to adjust the design accordingly.\n\nGiven this information, the test could show whether each design meets the requirement of having the concert area at least 150 meters from the road. If any design fails to meet this criterion, Cooper can then refine the design to ensure compliance with the city council's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the test could show that some designs meet the requirement while others do not, allowing Cooper to identify which designs are viable based on the specified distance requirement.\n\n\\boxed{Whether each design meets the requirement of having the concert area at least 150 meters from the road.}",

    "raw_response": "To find the biggest zero of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8}{4} \\), we need to determine the values of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(x) = 0 \\). This means solving the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8}{4} = 0 \\]\n\nFirst, we can multiply both sides by 4 to simplify:\n\n\\[ x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8 = 0 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the roots of the polynomial \\( x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8 \\). We can use the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of the polynomial is a factor of the constant term (-8) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8 \\).\n\nWe will test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial:\n\n1. Testing \\( x = 1 \\):\n   \\[ 1^3 + 3(1)^2 - 6(1) - 8 = 1 + 3 - 6 - 8 = -10 \\]\n   So, \\( x = 1 \\) is not a root.\n\n2. Testing \\( x = -1 \\):\n   \\[ (-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - 6(-1) - 8 = -1 + 3 + 6 - 8 = 0 \\]\n   So, \\( x = -1 \\) is a root.\n\nSince \\( x = -1 \\) is a root, we can factor \\( x + 1 \\) out of the polynomial \\( x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8 \\). We perform polynomial division of \\( x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n-1 & 1 & 3 & -6 & -8 \\\\\n   &   & -1 & -2 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n   & 1 & 2 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\( x^2 + 2x - 8 \\). So, we can write:\n\\[ x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8 = (x + 1)(x^2 + 2x - 8) \\]\n\nNext, we solve the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = -8 \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-8)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 32}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 6}{2} \\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-2 + 6}{2} = 2 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-2 - 6}{2} = -4 \\]\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial \\( x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8 \\) are \\( x = -1 \\), \\( x = 2 \\), and \\( x = -4 \\).

In this subspace:\n\n1. **Hue**: Represents the color's position on the color wheel.\n2. **Saturation**: Represents the intensity or purity of the color. Higher saturation means the color is more vivid, while lower saturation means it is more muted.\n\nIn the given figure:\n- Color A is located near the green area.\n- Color B is located near the blue area.\n- Color C is located near the red area.\n\nThe saturation coefficient is typically higher for colors that are more vivid and closer to the center of the color wheel (where the purest forms of each hue exist). Conversely, colors that are more muted and closer to the edges of the color wheel have lower saturation coefficients.\n\nFrom the figure:\n- Color A appears to be a lighter shade of green, which suggests it might have a moderate saturation.\n- Color B appears to be a darker shade of blue, which suggests it might have a lower saturation compared to pure blue.\n- Color C appears to be a darker shade of red, which also suggests it might have a lower saturation compared to pure red.\n\nSince both B and C appear to be darker shades, they likely have lower saturation coefficients than A.

    "raw_response": "To determine if the intensity mapping function \\( T: z = 1 - r \\) can be used to achieve the desired histogram specification, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given PDFs\n- **Fig. Q1a**: The PDF \\( p_r(r) \\) is a linear function from \\( r = 0 \\) to \\( r = 1 \\). It starts at \\( p_r(0) = 2 \\) and decreases linearly to \\( p_r(1) = 0 \\).\n- **Fig. Q1b**: The PDF \\( p_z(z) \\) is also a linear function from \\( z = 0 \\) to \\( z = 1 \\). It starts at \\( p_z(0) = 0 \\) and increases linearly to \\( p_z(1) = 2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Intensity Mapping Function\nThe proposed intensity mapping function is \\( T: z = 1 - r \\). This means that each pixel with intensity \\( r \\) in the original image will be mapped to an intensity \\( z = 1 - r \\) in the processed image.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Mapping\nLet's apply this mapping to the range of \\( r \\):\n- When \\( r = 0 \\), \\( z = 1 - 0 = 1 \\).\n- When \\( r = 1 \\), \\( z = 1 - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nThis mapping suggests that:\n- All pixels with \\( r = 0 \\) (intensity 0) will map to \\( z = 1 \\) (intensity 1).\n- All pixels with \\( r = 1 \\) (intensity 1) will map to \\( z = 0 \\) (intensity 0).\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Original and Desired PDFs\n- **Original PDF \\( p_r(r) \\)**: Linearly decreases from 2 to 0.\n- **Desired PDF \\( p_z(z) \\)**: Linearly increases from 0 to 2.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluating the Mapping\nThe mapping \\( z = 1 - r \\) does not preserve the linear relationship between \\( r \\) and \\( z \\). Specifically:\n- The original PDF \\( p_r(r) \\) is decreasing, but the mapping \\( z = 1 - r \\) reverses this direction.\n- The desired PDF \\( p_z(z) \\) is increasing, but the mapping \\( z = 1 - r \\) reverses this direction as well.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe intensity mapping function \\( T: z = 1 - r \\) does not correctly transform the original PDF \\( p_r(r) \\) into the desired PDF \\( p_z(z) \\). Therefore, it cannot achieve the goal of histogram specification.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}\n\\]",

    "extracted_answer": "Yes",
    "raw_response": "To determine if the epigraph of a function \\( f \\) is an infinite set, let's first define what the epigraph of a function is.\n\nThe epigraph of a function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\text{epi } f = \\{(x, t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid f(x) \\leq t\\}\n\\]\nThis means that the epigraph of \\( f \\) is the set of all points \\((x, t)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\) such that the value of the function \\( f \\) at \\( x \\) is less than or equal to \\( t \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of the epigraph:\n\n1. **Non-empty**: The epigraph is always non-empty because for any point \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\), we can choose \\( t = f(x) \\). Then, the point \\((x, f(x))\\) is in the epigraph since \\( f(x) \\leq f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Infinite**: To determine if the epigraph is infinite, we need to check if there are infinitely many points in the epigraph. Consider the following cases:\n\n   - **Continuous Function**: If \\( f \\) is a continuous function, it may still have an infinite number of points in its epigraph. For example, the function \\( f(x) = x \\) has an epigraph that includes all points \\((x, t)\\) where \\( t \\geq x \\). This epigraph is clearly infinite.\n   \n   - **Discontinuous Function**: Even if \\( f \\) is discontinuous, the epigraph can still be infinite. For instance, consider the function \\( f(x) = \\sin(x) \\). The epigraph of this function will include all points \\((x, t)\\) where \\( t \\geq \\sin(x) \\). Since the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, the epigraph will include infinitely many points.\n\n3. **General Case**: In general, for any function \\( f \\), the epigraph will be an infinite set unless \\( f \\) is a constant function (where \\( f(x) = c \\) for some constant \\( c \\)). In this case, the epigraph would be the set of all points \\((x, t)\\) where \\( t \\geq c \\), which is a half-plane and thus infinite.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can conclude that the epigraph of a function \\( f \\) is generally an infinite set, unless \\( f \\) is a constant function.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}\n\\]",

This suggests that the function could be periodic.\n\n2. **Amplitude**: The amplitude of the wave is constant, as the function oscillates between -1 and 1. This indicates that the function has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1.\n\n3. **Periodicity**: The function completes one full cycle over a certain interval. By observing the graph, we can see that the function repeats itself every 5 units on the x-axis. This means the period of the function is 5.\n\n4. **Symmetry**: The graph appears to be symmetric about the y-axis, which is characteristic of even functions. However, it also appears to be symmetric about the origin, which is characteristic of odd functions. Given the symmetry and the fact that the function oscillates around the x-axis, it is more likely to be an odd function.\n\n5. **General Form**: A function that fits these characteristics is a sine or cosine function, but since it is odd (symmetric about the origin), it is more likely to be a sine function.\n\nGiven these observations, the function is most likely a sine function with a period of 5.

If \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) are endpoints of a straight line segment and there is no additional information suggesting otherwise, we cannot determine \\( QR \\) solely based on the given segments.\n\nIf we assume \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) are endpoints of a straight line and there is no other information provided, then the length of \\( QR \\) would simply be the sum of the segments \\( QS \\) and \\( SR \\), but since \\( QS \\) is not given, we cannot determine \\( QR \\) without additional information.\n\nTherefore, with the given information, we cannot determine \\( QR \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\boxed{QR \\text{ cannot be determined with the given information}}",

This suggests that the function might not be convex because it has a local maximum, which is a characteristic of non-convex functions.\n\n3. **Second Derivative Test**: For a function of one variable, if the second derivative \\( f''(x) \\) is positive for all \\( x \\) in the domain, then the function is convex. However, for a function of multiple variables, we need to check the Hessian matrix. If the Hessian matrix is positive definite everywhere, the function is convex.\n\n4. **Hessian Matrix**: The Hessian matrix \\( H \\) for a function \\( f(x, y) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   H = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   For the function shown in the plot, the Hessian matrix would have negative eigenvalues at the peak, indicating that the function is concave at that point.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the function has a local maximum and the Hessian matrix is not positive definite, the function is not convex.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{\\text{No}}",

    "question": "A perceptual audio codec is used to compress an audio signal. The codec groups every 4 barks into a subband and then allocates bits to different subbands according to the result of a spectrum analysis based on a psychoacoustic model. All samples in the same subband are quantized with the same quantizer, and the bit resolution of which is allocated by the codec. (The Bark scale is a psychoacoustical scale proposed by Eberhard Zwicker in 1961.) Fig. Q1a shows the frequency spectrum of a windowed segment of audio signal. The psychoacoustic model shown in Fig. Q1b is used in the audio codec to derive the masking threshold for the audio segment. How many potential maskers in Fig. Q1a?",
    "gt": "7",
    "extracted_answer": "N",
    "raw_response": "To determine the number of potential maskers in the frequency spectrum shown in Fig. Q1a, we need to understand the concept of masking in psychoacoustics. Masking occurs when one sound (the masker) conceals the perception of another sound (the掩藏者) that is below its threshold of audibility.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Frequency Bands**: The frequency spectrum in Fig. Q1a is divided into multiple bands. Each band represents a subband in the audio codec.\n\n2. **Determine the Psychoacoustic Model**: The psychoacoustic model in Fig. Q1b provides the masking thresholds for each frequency band. These thresholds indicate the minimum level of a potential masker required to mask a掩藏者 at a given frequency.\n\n3. **Count the Potential Maskers**: A potential masker is any sound that can mask a掩藏者 if it is present at a sufficient level. In the context of the psychoacoustic model, this means identifying all the bands where the masking threshold is lower than the level of the掩藏者 in those bands.\n\n4. **Analyze the Spectrum**: By examining Fig. Q1a, we see that there are several peaks representing different frequencies. For each peak, we need to check if it falls below the masking threshold for the corresponding band as defined by the psychoacoustic model in Fig. Q1b.\n\n5. **Count the Peaks Below Thresholds**: \n   - Peak 1: Check if it is below the masking threshold for Band 1.\n   - Peak 2: Check if it is below the masking threshold for Band 2.\n   - Peak 3: Check if it is below the masking threshold for Band 3.\n   - Continue this process for all peaks.\n\n6. **Summarize the Results**: Count the number of peaks that fall below their respective masking thresholds.\n\nSince the exact values of the peaks and the masking thresholds are not provided in the figures, we cannot perform the exact numerical count here. However, the method described above should be followed to determine the number of potential maskers.\n\nGiven the lack of specific numerical data, the final answer would be:\n\n\\boxed{N} \n\nWhere \\( N \\) is the number of peaks in the frequency spectrum that fall below their respective masking thresholds as determined by the psychoacoustic model.",

    "raw_response": "To determine what could increase the number of krill in the given food web, we need to consider the factors that influence the population dynamics of krill. Krill are primary consumers and are prey for many other organisms in this ecosystem. The factors that can affect their population include:\n\n1. **Nutrient Availability**: Krill feed on phytoplankton, which requires nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. An increase in these nutrients can lead to an increase in phytoplankton, which in turn supports more krill.\n\n2. **Predator Pressure**: If the predators of krill (such as seals, birds, and fish) decrease, there will be less predation pressure on krill, potentially leading to an increase in their population.\n\n3. **Climate Conditions**: Changes in temperature and salinity can affect the growth and survival of phytoplankton, which in turn affects krill populations.\n\n4. **Human Activities**: Overfishing of krill or its predators, pollution, and other human activities can also impact the krill population.\n\nGiven the options, the most direct and common factor that could increase the number of krill is an increase in nutrient availability, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, which support the growth of phytoplankton.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{An increase in nutrient availability}",

Therefore, ∠AOB = 360° - ∠P - ∠OAP - ∠OBP = 360° - 50° - 90° - 90° = 130°.\n\n4. **Use the fact that AC is the diameter:**\n   - Since AC is the diameter, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle that subtends the semicircle. According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n   - The arc AB is the same as the arc subtended by ∠AOB, which is 130°. Therefore, ∠ABC = 1/2 * 130° = 65°.\n\n5. **Determine the measure of ∠ACB:**\n   - Since AC is the diameter, ∠ACB is a right angle (90°) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always 90°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of ∠ACB is \\boxed{90°}.",

    "raw_response": "To determine the voltage and current across \\( R_L \\), we need to analyze the given circuit step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Circuit\nThe circuit is a Wheatstone bridge configuration with an additional resistor \\( R_L \\) connected in parallel with the bridge. The bridge consists of resistors \\( R_1 \\), \\( R_2 \\), \\( R_3 \\), and \\( R_4 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Check for Balance\nFirst, let's check if the bridge is balanced. A Wheatstone bridge is balanced when:\n\\[\n\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{R_3}{R_4}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\text{k}\\Omega}{2.2 \\text{k}\\Omega} = \\frac{2.2 \\text{k}\\Omega}{1.5 \\text{k}\\Omega}\n\\]\n\nCalculate each ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2.2} \\approx 0.4545\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{2.2}{1.5} \\approx 1.4667\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 0.4545 \\neq 1.4667 \\), the bridge is not balanced.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Voltage Across \\( R_L \\)\nSince the bridge is not balanced, the voltage across \\( R_L \\) will be different from zero. We can use the formula for the voltage across a non-balanced Wheatstone bridge:\n\n\\[\nV_{R_L} = V_s \\times \\frac{R_L}{R_1 + R_L}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\\[\nV_{R_L} = 5 \\text{V} \\times \\frac{4.7 \\text{k}\\Omega}{1 \\text{k}\\Omega + 4.7 \\text{k}\\Omega}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the denominator:\n\\[\n1 \\text{k}\\Omega + 4.7 \\text{k}\\Omega = 5.7 \\text{k}\\Omega\n\\]\n\nNow calculate the voltage:\n\\[\nV_{R_L} = 5 \\text{V} \\times \\frac{4.7 \\text{k}\\Omega}{5.7 \\text{k}\\Omega} \\approx 5 \\text{V} \\times 0.8214 \\approx 4.107 \\text{V}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Current Through \\( R_L \\)\nThe current through \\( R_L \\) can be found using Ohm's law:\n\\[\nI_{R_L} = \\frac{V_{R_L}}{R_L}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nI_{R_L} = \\frac{4.107 \\text{V}}{4.7 \\text{k}\\Omega} \\approx 0.874 \\text{mA}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answers\nThe voltage across \\( R_L \\) is approximately:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4.11 \\text{V}}\n\\]\n\nThe current through \\( R_L \\) is approximately:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.874 \\text{mA}}\n\\]",

The image shows four matchsticks arranged in a cross shape.\n2. There is one vertical matchstick and three horizontal matchsticks.\n3. The vertical matchstick is at the center and connects two horizontal matchsticks.\n\nTo form a square, we need four sides of equal length. Currently, the arrangement does not form a square because:\n- The vertical matchstick is not part of any side of the square.\n- The horizontal matchsticks do not connect end-to-end to form a closed shape.\n\nTo fix this, we need to move one of the horizontal matchsticks so that it forms a complete square with the other matchsticks. Specifically, we can move one of the horizontal matchsticks to connect with the vertical matchstick at both ends, forming a square.\n\nLet's consider moving the top horizontal matchstick:\n- If we move the top horizontal matchstick down to connect with the vertical matchstick at both ends, it will form a square with the left and right horizontal matchsticks.\n\nTherefore, the matchstick that needs to be moved is the **top horizontal matchstick**.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{top horizontal matchstick}}",

So, ∠OAB = ∠OBA.\n   - The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180°. Therefore, we can write:\n     \\[\n     ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180°\n     \\]\n   - Since ∠OAB = ∠OBA, we can substitute ∠OBA with ∠OAB:\n     \\[\n     ∠OAB + ∠OAB + 70° = 180°\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2∠OAB + 70° = 180°\n     \\]\n   - Solving for ∠OAB:\n     \\[\n     2∠OAB = 180° - 70°\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2∠OAB = 110°\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     ∠OAB = \\frac{110°}{2} = 55°\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of ∠OAB is \\boxed{55}.",
